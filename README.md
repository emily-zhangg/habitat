# habitat

## 🌲 Background

## 🍁 User Problem
1. Creating a habit is difficult
2. Users often find themselves discarding habits that they hope to create for reasons such as work got busy, or that they start to have more commitments

## 🥕 Objective
Drawing from the book, Atomic habits, part of making creating a habit easy is accessibility and accountability
1. The app aims to make users accountable for the habits that they wish to uphold by creating a habit tracker that requires the user to check in frequently
2. In order to not make forming a habit any harder, the app will be easily accessible and the user can easily clock their progress with a click

## 🎣 Features
##### Taking care of a pet
For each habit that the user wants to form, they will have to choose an avatar that represents their goal. Frequent check ins will be needed to keep their avatar alive and too many missed check ins will kill their avatar. As the user progress in their goals, the avatar will transform and upgrade.

##### Login Features
1. User can create an account
2. User can login to their account

##### Connect with other habit formers
1. To increase accountability, users can view habits set by others as well as others progress
2. Users can follow their friends (nice to have)

##### Receive Reminders
Users will receive email reminders to perform the habit that they want to form
